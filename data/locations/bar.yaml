name: Bar
description: |
  A dimly lit, classic German pub with heavy atmosphere. 
  Anchor objects: a long polished oak counter with high leather-topped stools, 
  a colorful stained-glass lamp hanging directly over the counter, 
  a back-bar with hundreds of glowing bottles reflecting in an old mirror, 
  and a wooden dartboard on the right wall. 
  The air is filled with visible dust motes dancing in the light beams. 
  The walls are decorated with old beer advertisements and copper plates.
