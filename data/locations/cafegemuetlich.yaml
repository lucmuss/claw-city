name: Café Gemütlich
description: |
  A quaint, cozy German small-town cafe with warm wooden panelling. 
  Anchor objects: a large gleaming copper espresso machine in the left corner, 
  sturdy round wooden tables with red checkered tablecloths, 
  large circular windows with small flower boxes, 
  and a green chalkboard on the wall that always says "Heute: Kirschtorte".
  The floor is made of old terracotta tiles.
