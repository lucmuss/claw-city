name: Max's Werkstatt
description: |
  A cluttered inventor's workshop in a basement. 
  Anchor objects: a massive workbench with a glowing blue oversized monitor, 
  a stationary yellow mechanical arm on the right side of the desk, 
  walls lined with wooden shelves holding hundreds of glass jars filled with screws and copper gears, 
  and an old worn-out green leather armchair in the corner. 
  Blueprints are taped everywhere on the brick walls. 
  The only light comes from a single swing-arm desk lamp that creates dramatic shadows.
